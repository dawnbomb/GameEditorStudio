To help people understand it, i made it look like eventing in RPG maker, so if you already know that then your 90% of the way there. Also i know this is a long tutorial but eventing is actually REALLY simple. &#xA;&#xA;To start with, when you create an event it gets added to the events menu in the workshop (thats the menu uou opened to get here). Events are saved as part of the workshop, not as part of a project. So when you create events, keep in mind that other people can use them as well.  &#xA;&#xA;------------------- Basic Events -------------------&#xA;Events are just a list of commands. When you run an Event, each command  is run one after another. On the right side is the Commands panel, these are the things that happen when an event is run. When you first create an event it's empty, but has a blank command that cannot be removed.&#xA;&#xA;To add a new command to an event, you can right click any command in the commands panel (Including the blank command) and select New Command. This will open a Commands window with a huge list of commands sorted into categorys on the left side. Clicking any command will add it to the event, and it's inserted below the command you selected New Command from. Note that the Blank Command is always last. &#xA;&#xA;Before you continue any further, try creating a really basic event. For example, create an event with the commands Save Everything and Open Project Output Folder. Then run the event from the workshop's Events menu.  &#xA;&#xA;PS: Give your event a name! You can't create a new event if an existing event is already named New Event.&#xA; &#xA;PPS: In this example Save Everything will already save the event, but if your doing anything else, you can save events from File -&gt; Save Events. &#xA;&#xA;----------------- Advanced Events ------------------&#xA;Most Commands in the eventing system use Resources. Commands that use resources have a dropdown menu in the command panel to select what resource to use. &#xA;&#xA;Resources are managed in two places. The first place is the Resource Manager at the bottom of the Events window. This is where you add new files and folders for events to use. The second place is the Project Resources panel, where a user says where their resource is located.&#xA;&#xA;Lets create an event that runs / launches a game. It can be any game that you have installed. &#xA;- Create a new event and add the command &quot;Run Program&quot; to it. &#xA;- In the resource manager click New File and give it any name.&#xA;- In the command's dropdown, select that file. &#xA;- You should probably go to File -&gt; Save Events&#xA;- In your project Resources, click browse and select any games exe.&#xA;- Run the event from the events menu.&#xA;&#xA;This is hopefully an easy to follow example for advanced events.&#xA;However many of you are romhacking, so lets try another example. &#xA;- Make an event with the commands &quot;Save Everything&quot; and &quot;Run Program with File&quot;. &#xA;- Have an emulator run with a game rom. &#xA;This is a simple event that most romhackers working on old games will find very helpful. &#xA;&#xA;PS: Note that a use is NOT REQUIRED to setup their project resources to launch a workshop. However events where their resources are missing will be gray'd out in the menu.&#xA;&#xA;PPS: Note that Resources not actually used by any event are not saved as part of the workshop. I though a long time about this, but i made it this way so it's guarenteed that the Project Resources panel is guarenteed to only be asking users for resources that are actually used for events, and not just random unused stuff.   &#xA;&#xA;PPPS: New tools and commands are added to Game Editor Studio over time.&#xA;&#xA;--------------- Super Advanced Events ---------------- &#xA;The eventing system is way stronger then just being able to run a game. For example heres a common solution to games with unpacked files. &#xA;- 1: save all files&#xA;- 2: Repack X files&#xA;- 3: Move only the repacked files to folder X&#xA;- 4: Repack rom at folder X&#xA;- 5: Run Emulator with game rom! &#xA;&#xA;It can also help solve setup for a new user. You can create a first time setup event where a user supplys a game folder and the event will unpack all the game files and move them and such.&#xA;&#xA;Some games however just need even more advanced solutions. For these cases, i have two more super advanced options. &#xA;1: The first is the command to run your own code in command prompt. This opens up all kinda of things, but obviously you need to know how to actually do that. &#xA;2: The second is the ability to run your own programs. You can place any custom programs you made inside the Workshops/workshop/Tools folder. This is diffrent from the Tools folder in the main game editor studio folder, and is for your own third party programs. Then you can have the command prompt command run your custom program.  &#xA;&#xA;I hope this is powerful enough for most problems, but if it's not, you can ask me on discord for whatever else you need.
