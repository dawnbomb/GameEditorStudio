========================== Font =====================================

I used Ark Pixel Font from here 
https://github.com/TakWolf/ark-pixel-font
I'm using 10px Propertional JA (The JA means using the japanese region version of symbol appearance of JP symbols)
and i got it on June 15 2025

I then used FontForge and changed it...
I change the space character (20) from 500 width to 400 width
In Element -> Font Info, i change the font name in the PS names tab.
And in the OS/2 tab -> Metrics tab, i clicked really use type metrics, and -400 typo line gap
Then i generated fonts using type: TrueType

After that, i double clicked the new font file, installed, and moved the font file into my project.

In the future its a good idea to update the font to the latest, as not all JP symbols have been made yet.
Although, if a user attempts to see a missing symbol, WPF seems to default back to segoe UI font. 

Although it was tempting to yoink the asperite font, if you change asperites language to Japanese, 
the JP glyphs look eye burningly horrible. Sorry asperite, but you really need better JP support! D:

========================== Cursor =====================================

I was surprised to find out while googleing for a cursor, because i liked asperites and they inspired me, 
but actually they yoinked their cursor from this pack https://aspecsgaming.itch.io/pixel-art-cursors

So i'm doing the exact same thing! I like the cursor, what can i say. 
I'm especially a fan of it using inverted colors. <3
