I used Ark Pixel Font from here 
https://github.com/TakWolf/ark-pixel-font
I'm using 10px Propertional JA (The JA means using the japanese region version of symbol appearance of JP symbols)
and i got it on June 15 2025

I then used FontForge and changed it...
I change the space character (20) from 500 width to 400 width
In Element -> Font Info, i change the font name in the PS names tab.
And in the OS/2 tab -> Metrics tab, i clicked really use type metrics, and -400 typo line gap
Then i generated fonts using type: TrueType

After that, i double clicked the new font file, installed, and moved the font file into my project.

In the future its a good idea to update the font to the latest, as not all JP symbols have been made yet.
Although, if a user attempts to see a missing symbol, WPF seems to default back to segoe UI font.
