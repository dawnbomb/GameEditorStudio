I'm not great at legal stuff, so here i will try and put this as *clearly* as i can.

I the creator of Crystal Editor, as in the account currently by the name of "Dawnbomb"  who owns this repository on github,  is the sole owner of anything and everything in this repository. Every Line of code, every image, every resource, every last thing. If you contibute, you hand over any rights you have or would have to any contribution in whatever country you are in. You lose all rights to everything you contirbute. Even rights that are not explicitly stated, you lose the rights to. For countrys with diffrent legal terms, to speak as clearly as possible, you help me in exchange for nothing, and you may not claim anything in this repository / project as your own even if you created it yourself. The only exception to this, is if something you created ends up here, by someone other then yourself adding it. 

For every single thing, line of code, etc, you contribute, you lose the rights to it. In every way, Physically, Digitally, theoretically, actually, imaginatively, in this world, the universe, and all of existance, and any other creative law speak terms of ways or methods or locations to own things, i own the rights everything you contribute (as in a pull request) to Crystal Editor.

In addition to no rights, you agree that anything you add to Crystal Editor, is infact your own creation. That you are not stealing, or taking the works of anyone else and adding or attempting to add them to the project in a pull request. If you were to do so, under whatever laws apply, I / Crystal Editor, will hold you legally liable for any theft from angry third partys for infringing on their rights.


ALL RIGHTS ARE RESERVED, this is NOT Open Source. 
=============================================================================================================================================================
One day i may sell Crystal Editor, although maybe under a diffrent name, on steam or other platforms or websites. I want all rights as mine, and mine alone, to be able to do that. 

If you download the project, add code to it, and make a pull request and it is accepted, you cannot claim any ownership to anything in here.  This lisence is the way it is, for the following reasons.

1)  I need it this way to potentially, if i choose to, sell or monetize the program, in order to hire people to make it better. if i do, anyone who contributed to this project gets absolutely nothing, can claim nothing, and has ownership or copywrite to nothing.

2) I have had projects where someone demanded their things back, that were so integrated into the core of a project, removing them completly destroyed the project. Other times it set the project many months behind. I refuse to allow this to happen to Crystal Editor.

3) I have dealt with far to many bad actors over the years, and after finally filing and wining some lawsuits, i'm done trusting people. If you want some rights, contact me and ask. However any would be rights, would be explicitly added to this lisence document. Any supposed rights from deals anyone claims to have made with me, not explicitly acnowledged in this document are fake. 


The only things added to this repository i do not claim to own, are classified as "Tools" with Crystal Editor.  A Tool is a program made by someone else, that does something i did not make, nor anyone directly in this project. At the time of writing this agreement (December 6 2022), all tools currently in the project are all open source, except 010 editor. Any potential future sale of crystal editor, is not a sale of any such Tools. (CE uses the free demo version of 010, not the paid version. Users must buy 010 off their website to access the full version of that Tool). However, in the future i may attempt to request usage of certain not free/open tools to allow them to be added to Crystal Editor.
