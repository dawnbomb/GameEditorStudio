        <Label Content="Hey gamers! :3 This program is my life's work, my masterpiece, filling my &#xA;deep wish for simplified game modding. I've devoted countless hours of my life, &#xD;&#xA;heart, and soul into this. So before you start, i have some things to say. &#xA;&#xA;UNACCETPABLY to many times, i see people make editors and refuse to share them,&#xA;tell others what parts of a game they are &quot;ALLOWED&quot; to mod (especially DLC), &#xA;and act to claim modding spaces and police them with aggression. &gt;:(&#xA;&#xA;If your using this, we are ALL modders, we ALL, NECESSARILY, make editors, &#xA;mods, and otherwise, WITHOUT asking for permission. Don't let people or communities&#xA;pressure you out of modding games! Our releases make the world a more fun place!&#xA;THAT MATTERS A LOT! It's why this is worth dedicating my life to. &#xA; &#xA;AND SO, to fight back in the small way i can, i'm adding a terms and conditions here.
