        <Label Content="Hey-o~ :3 I've Devoted countless hours of my life, heart, and soul into crystal editor.&#xA;This IS my life's work, my MASTERPIECE. It Fills my deep wish for simplified game modding.&#xA;Now before you start, i've been modding since age 10, and i have some things to say. &#xA;&#xA;Unacceptably to many times, i have seen people in modding spaces act to &quot;Claim&quot; them.&#xA;Motivated by clout, patreon, spite, moral superiority, &quot;Ownership&quot; of the space, i've seen it all.&#xA;Hell, half of my drive creating this program was from the anger i felt at these damn people. &#xA;They make editors and refuse to share them, or create mods then say no one else can.  &#xA;Worse yet sometimes they try to declare what parts of a game your ALLOWED to mod.&#xA;&quot;No modding the DLC!&quot;, &quot;Your NOT ALLOWED to use my mod!&quot;, or worst of all booby trapping mods! &#xA;(Looking at you FF14 Gshade virus installer, or the guy who made Special-K and put force crash in it).&#xA;&#xA;Don't lose hope. For every gatekeeping community like BotW or Persona,&#xA;there are some really amazing ones like Touhou, Fire Emblem, or Pokemon.&#xA;If your using this, were ALL modders, we ALL make mods without asking for permission.&#xA;Don't let people pressure you out of modding a game in the way you want, or using what you want.  &#xA;Mods make the world a more fun place, they get people through depression, or become a best experience.  &#xA;Towards that goal, i want to do what i can to fight against toxic modders. &#xA; &#xA;This program i've poured myself into automatically generates high quality editors from game files.&#xA;Editors are easy to use, and designed extremely on purpose for ANYONE to make changes to and redistribute.&#xD;&#xA;I want to fight back against toxic, selfish modders, and help create a better modding community at large.
